- [demo-burgers-equation.ipynb](demo-burgers-equation.ipynb) - time-dependent PDEs. Burgers equation

- [2D-heat-deepxde.ipynb](2D-heat-deepxde.ipynb) - code based on [Issue #61](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde/issues/61) from deepxde repo

- [poisson-l-shaped.ipynb](poisson-l-shaped.ipynb) - from https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/pinn_forward/poisson.Lshape.html

Comparison of different backends, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [Paddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en), for the [Poisson equation in L-shaped domain](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/pinn_forward/poisson.lshape.html):
